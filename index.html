        <h2>Pat's Mission Statement</h2>
        <p class="missionStatementP1">
          If you've found your way here, then you too have a healthy
          appreciation of confectionary and wild migratory fish! I'm Patricia,
          the founder and CEO of Pat's Salmon Cookies, and I am delighted to
          meet you. People laughed when I dreamed up the concept of a
          salmon-shaped, human and fish friendly, coffee time biscuit... but
          looks who's laughing now!
        </p>
        <p class="missionStatementP2">
          Our product went viral worldwide and we are now rapidly expanding from
          mental kitchen table business to multiple stores in extremely high
          cost of living cities! Will the numbers stack up Pat? How could they
          not!?
        </p>
        <p class="missionStatementP3">
          Everyone wants to share their biscuits with frolicking fishies,
          welcome to the revolution!
